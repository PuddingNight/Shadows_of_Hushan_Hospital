## Presentation :
Shadows of Hushan Hospital is a text-based adventure game that takes you on a haunting journey through an abandoned hospital. You must explore the hospital, uncover its dark secrets, and put an end to the supernatural forces that still linger within its walls.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter ghosts, discover clues, and interact with objects that will help you piece together the hospital's history. Some decision you make will affect the outcome of the game, adding an element of unpredictability.
