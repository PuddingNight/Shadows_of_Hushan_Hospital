# Shadows_of_Hushan_Hospital
This was a two days project (that turned into one week) to make an old school text based adventure game where you make your own decisions in order to uncover the mysteries of a spooky hospital. Everything is meant to run in the Python terminal. Only time and random libraries were used.
