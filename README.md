This was a two days project (that turned into one week) to make an old school text based adventure game where you make your own decisions in order to uncover the mysteries of a spooky hospital.

As the player progresses, they find clues and interact with various objects that help piece together the story of the hospital's dark past. The player also encounters several ghosts who provide additional information and backstory.

The ultimate goal of the game is to discover the secrets of the hospital and put an end to the supernatural forces that still haunt the abandoned building.

Everything is meant to run in the Python terminal. Only time and random libraries were used. The code is dirty as it was a challenge to get everything out in a timely manner, without looking how other people did it.
