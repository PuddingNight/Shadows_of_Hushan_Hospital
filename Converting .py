You are Luo Mei Ling, a Chinese PhD student studying parapsychology in the United States.\n
You've always been fascinated by the paranormal and psychology, which led you to pursue a career in parapsychology.\n
You've studied under some of the top researchers in the field, and you've gained a reputation as one of the most promising young parapsychologists in the country.\n
Recently, you received word that your mother in Hushan, China has fallen ill. You felt compelled to return to your hometown to be with her, and to see if there's anything you can do to help.\n
You haven't been back to Hushan since you were a child, but you remember it as a bustling mining town nestled in the mountains\n
As you arrive in Hushan, you're struck by how much has changed.\n
The town is almost deserted now, with most of the shops and businesses closed down.\n
The streets are empty, and the few people you see give you a wide berth. You can't help but feel a sense of unease, like something isn't right.\n
Ever since you were young, you've had strange visions that have fascinated you with the paranormal and psychology.\n
Some of these visions are disturbing, violent, or take you to strange, nonsensical places with impossible architecture.\n
You've tried to ignore them over the years, but they've only become more frequent and intense.\n
It's been a few days since you arrived in Hushan, and you've been having strange dreams about the hospital on the mountain.\n
You remember it as a place where you went as a child when you were sick, but now it's abandoned and decrepit.\n
The dreams are always the same - you're wandering through the dark halls of the hospital, and there's a sense of impending doom.\n
One night, you're lying in bed, trying to sleep, when you hear a creepy voice that sounds like your father's voice.\n
Your father passed away many years ago, and you haven't thought about him in a long time.\n
The voice begs you to go find him in the hospital, as he needs your help.\n
You're not sure if it's a dream or if you're really hearing his voice, but you feel a strong urge to investigate.\n
